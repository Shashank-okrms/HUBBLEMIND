## üìã **Project Overview**

This project aims to predict **Amazon's stock price** using various financial and market indicators such as:
- Crude Oil Price
- Bitcoin Price
- Nasdaq 100 Index
- S&P 500 Index
- And many more...

By analyzing historical data and applying machine learning models, we provide insights into the relationships between these indicators and Amazon's stock price.
